# Threat Hunting MCP Server

A next-generation Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that **hunts for behaviors, not indicators**. Built on the philosophy that effective threat hunting focuses on adversary **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** at the top of the Pyramid of Pain—the behaviors that are hardest for attackers to change.

## Philosophy: Hunt Behaviors, Not Indicators

This MCP server is designed around a core principle from the **[Pyramid of Pain](https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html)**:

```

**Why behavioral hunting?**
- **Hash values** → Adversaries change in seconds
- **IP addresses** → Adversaries change in minutes
- **Domain names** → Adversaries change in hours
- **Network/Host artifacts** → Adversaries change in days
- **Tools** → Adversaries change in weeks
- **TTPs (Behaviors)** → Adversaries change in months/years ✅ **Hunt for these!**

When you hunt for *how* adversaries behave rather than *what* specific indicators they use, you create durable detections that survive indicator rotation and force adversaries to fundamentally change their operations.

## Behavioral Hunting Examples

### What We Hunt For (Top of Pyramid)

**✅ Good: Behavioral Patterns (TTPs)**
- Process injection techniques (T1055.*) - behavior persists across tools
- LSASS memory access patterns - fundamental credential theft behavior
- Lateral movement via remote services - core post-compromise behavior
- Living-off-the-Land binaries (LOLBins) - detection-evasion behavior
- Parent-child process anomalies - execution pattern behaviors
- Kerberoasting patterns - Active Directory attack behaviors

**❌ Avoid: Atomic Indicators (Easy to Change)**
- Specific malware hashes - trivial to modify
- Known-bad IP addresses - adversaries rotate rapidly
- C2 domain names - disposable infrastructure
- Specific file paths - easily changed

### Behavioral Hunt Examples

**Example 1: Credential Access Behavior**
```
Hunt for: Any process accessing LSASS memory (T1003.001)
Why: This behavior is required for credential theft, regardless of the tool
Tools that use it: Mimikatz, ProcDump, custom malware
Detection persists: Even when tools change
```

**Example 2: Lateral Movement Behavior**
```
Hunt for: Remote execution patterns via WMI/DCOM/SMB (T1021.*)
Why: Fundamental behavior for spreading through networks
Tools that use it: PsExec, Impacket, WMIC, custom tools
Detection persists: Even with infrastructure/tool rotation
```

**Example 3: Defense Evasion Behavior**
```
Hunt for: Process injection patterns (T1055.*)
Why: Core evasion technique requiring specific OS API calls
Tools that use it: Cobalt Strike, Metasploit, custom loaders
Detection persists: API call patterns remain consistent
```

### Quick Behavioral Hunt Examples

Try these natural language queries focused on behaviors:

```bash
# Credential Access Behaviors
"Hunt for any process accessing LSASS memory (T1003.001)"
"Find credential dumping patterns regardless of tool used"

# Lateral Movement Behaviors
"Detect lateral movement via remote execution (T1021.*)"
"Hunt for RDP/WMI/PsExec execution patterns"

# Process Injection Behaviors
"Find process injection into system processes (T1055)"
"Detect CreateRemoteThread patterns across all tools"

# Living-off-the-Land Behaviors
"Hunt for PowerShell download cradles (T1059.001)"
"Detect LOLBin abuse patterns (certutil, bitsadmin, etc.)"

# Command and Control Behaviors
"Find C2 beaconing patterns regardless of infrastructure"
"Detect DNS tunneling behaviors (T1071.004)"
```

**Notice:** These focus on **adversary behaviors** that persist across tool/infrastructure changes, not specific IOCs that change hourly.

   Add to your Claude Code settings (`.claude/config.json` or settings UI):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "threat-hunting": {
         "command": "python3",
         "args": ["-u", "/path/to/threat_hunting_mcp/run_server.py"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Start using it**:

   Open Claude Code and try natural language queries:
   - "Show me HEARTH hunts for credential access"
   - "Recommend threat hunts for my Windows AD environment"
   - "What's the tactic coverage in HEARTH?"

## Hunting Methodologies

### TaHiTI Framework ⭐ NEW

Developed by the Dutch Payments Association, TaHiTI (Targeted Hunting integrating Threat Intelligence) provides a standardized methodology combining threat intelligence with hunting practices. The framework features three phases: **Initialize** (trigger and abstract), **Hunt** (hypothesis and investigation), and **Finalize** (validation and handover). Built on intelligence-driven focus with continuous enrichment, risk-based prioritization, and collaborative information sharing.

### PEAK Framework

Simple, practical framework with three phases: **Prepare** (research and hypotheses), **Execute** (analyze and investigate), **Act with Knowledge** (document and detect). Supports three hunt types: Hypothesis-Driven, Baseline, and Model-Assisted (M-ATH).

### SQRRL Framework

Features a Hunting Maturity Model (HMM0-HMM4), Hunt Loop (Hypothesis → Investigate → Patterns → Analytics), and Hunt Matrix mapping activities to maturity levels.

**See [FRAMEWORKS.md](FRAMEWORKS.md) for detailed framework documentation, examples, and implementation guidance.**

## HEARTH Community Integration ⭐ NEW

Integrates with **[HEARTH](https://github.com/THORCollective/HEARTH)** (Hunting Exchange and Research Threat Hub), an open-source repository of 50+ professionally-curated threat hunting hypotheses.
